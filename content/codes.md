**k-Sparse Component Analysis via k-subsapce clustering** 

Sparse Component Analysis (SCA) and k-Sparse Component Analysis (k-SCA) are both techniques used in signal processing and source separation. The main difference between SCA and k-SCA  lies in their assumptions about the number of active sources: SCA assumes one active source at each time instant, whereas k-SCA allows for varying numbers of active sources represented by 'k'.

In other words, SCA considers a single active source at a time, while k-SCA accommodates multiple active sources, making it more flexible for different scenarios.

We presnted a method for mixing matrix identification  and blind source separation that improves upon existing k-sparse source approaches, especially in noisy real-world situations with k=m-1. Explore my open-source projects and tools related to k-SCA below:
