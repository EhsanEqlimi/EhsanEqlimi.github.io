**My Brainy Decade: OHBM Conference**

In 2013, I entered the world of neuroscience at OHBM. Winning the Abstract Award in 2014 was a standout moment.

Now, after a decade of experiments and late nights, I'm thrilled to present my latest findings titled 'Alpha Oscillations During Speech Information Encoding' at OHBM 2024. It's more than a title; it's the culmination of ten years of exploring the complexities of the mind. Looking forward to the next steps in my neuroscience journey!
