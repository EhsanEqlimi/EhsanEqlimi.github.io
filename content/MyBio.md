**About my name**

My name is Ehsan, pronounced /eh sa:n/ in IPA and written as احسان in Persian/Farsi. It's often mispronounced as [i:za:n] and misspelled as Eshan. Think of it as 'eh + sun,' with the emphasis on 'sun,' so I'm sometimes called 'Ehsun' for a sunnier pronunciation :)

Ehsan means "benefaction" in Persian, meaning "to do beautiful things." My last name, Eqlimi, is pronounced /eqliːˈmiː/ or /eɣliːˈmiː/, written as اقلیمی. The 'q' sound is like 'r' in French or 'gh/غ' in Arabic, and in modern Persian, it's closer to /ɣ/ than /q/.

Like my first name, associated with the sun, my last name, Eqlimi, relates to weather or climate. "اقلیم" (Eqlim) in Persian is derived from the Greek "κλίμα" (klima), meaning "climate" or "region".
