My name is **Ehsan**, pronounced /eh saːn/ in IPA and written as **احسان** in Persian/Farsi. It’s often mispronounced as [iːzaːn] and misspelled as *Eshan*. Think of it as *“eh + sun”*, with the emphasis on *sun*—so I’m sometimes called *Ehsun* for a sunnier pronunciation :) Ehsan means *"benefaction"*, or more poetically, *"to do beautiful things."*

My last name, **Eqlimi**, is pronounced /eqliːˈmiː/ or /eɣliːˈmiː/, written as **اقلیمی**. The letter ‘q’ in Persian approximates the French ‘r’ or Arabic ‘gh’ (غ); in modern Persian, it often sounds closer to /ɣ/ than /q/. Just as my first name is linked to *sun*, my last name relates to *weather* or *climate*. The word "اقلیم" (*Eqlim*) is derived from the Greek *κλίμα* (*klima*), meaning *climate* or *region*.

I was born and raised in **Tehran, Iran**, and have lived in **Ardebil**, **Tabriz**, and again **Tehran** before moving to **Ghent, Belgium** in 2017.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [**BEAMS Group**](https://beams.polytech.ulb.be/) at [**Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB)**](https://www.ulb.be/en) in Brussels.  
Before that, I worked at the [**WAVES-Acoustic Group**](https://www.waves.intec.ugent.be/) at [**Ghent University**](https://www.ugent.be/en) and [**imec**](https://www.imec-int.com/en), where I also completed my PhD in biomedical engineering in 2022.  
Earlier, I had started a PhD in biomedical engineering at the **Tehran University of Medical Sciences**, where I passed the comprehensive exam before deciding to shift focus and pursue opportunities in Europe.

Before academia, I worked as an **Image Processing Scientist** at [**Sciences Green (SGI)**](https://www.sgi.ir/?lang=en) and [**Matiran**](https://matiran.ir/about-matiran/) in Tehran, focusing on biometric and segmentation technologies.

When I’m not analyzing brain signals or medical images, I’m probably reading philosophy, theoretical physics, or mathematics—with music always in the background.  
Here’s the playlist I listened to throughout my PhD: 🎧 [**Something is dancing in my brain**](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ezdJcKNRJW1cQwrQqpxUx?si=233f1f68334c44c3)  
And here are some that followed: [**Mr.Fox**](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6R801YrXceGUgg3GrErbCm?si=6165dac48a804517) & [**Under shower with open eyes**](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07fgbpqkXvKX9g9NcWno4X?si=98ca0687f0e74bbe)

## 🧪 Research Highlights

My PhD uncovered two key findings:
1. **Distinct frequency-specific brain oscillations** correlate with **attentional engagement** during speech perception.
2. I developed a method to **quantify engagement** by tracking **EEG signal complexity over time**.
