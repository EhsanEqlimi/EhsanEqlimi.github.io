## Computational neurosdynamics 

We study how the brain evolves over time using continuous EEG signals during both spontaneous states, such as mind-wandering and resting-state, and structured, continuous tasks, including speech tracking, music listening, and naturalistic cognition.

We develop and apply computational methods to track neural dynamics, uncovering how information is processed, maintained, and integrated over time. By combining signal processing, time-series analysis, and modeling techniques, we aim to reveal the temporal structure of brain activity and its relation to behavior and perception.

 Our work emphasizes continuous, naturalistic paradigms rather than discrete trials, providing insight into the brain’s ongoing computations in real-world-like contexts.

## Lab Ethos

We prioritize **open, reproducible, and transparent research**. Sharing code, data, and methods is central to our approach. We encourage curiosity-driven research, collaboration, and mentoring, fostering an environment where ideas can be explored rigorously and creatively.

---

## Philosophy

Our philosophy is that the brain should be studied **as it operates naturally over time**, rather than only through artificial, discrete experiments. Continuous, naturalistic EEG recordings capture the ongoing dynamics of cognition, attention, and perception, offering richer insights into neural computation.

---

## Vision

We aim to understand how **neural dynamics unfold over time** in both spontaneous and task-driven activity. By integrating EEG with computational modeling, we hope to reveal principles of brain function, bridging basic neuroscience with real-world applications in cognition, learning, and behavior.
