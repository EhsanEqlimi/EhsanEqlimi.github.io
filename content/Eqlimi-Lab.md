## Computational neurosdynamics 

At Eqlimi lab, we study how the brain evolves over time using continuous EEG recordings. Our focus is on capturing the dynamic patterns of neural activity during both spontaneous states, such as mind-wandering and resting-state, and structured, continuous tasks, including speech tracking, music listening, and naturalistic cognition.

We develop and apply computational methods to track neural dynamics moment by moment, uncovering how information is processed, maintained, and integrated over time. By combining signal processing, time-series analysis, and modeling techniques, we aim to reveal the temporal structure of brain activity and its relation to behavior and perception. Our work emphasizes continuous, naturalistic paradigms rather than discrete trials, providing insight into the brain’s ongoing computations in real-world-like contexts.

## Team

- **Ehsan Eqlimi, PhD | Head of Lab & Founder**


<small>Ehsan leads the lab, developing algorithms to study brain activity with EEG. He focuses on how the brain activity unfolds over time during natural tasks and spontaneous states, combining signal processing, machine learning, and neuroscience. He holds a PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Ghent University, Belgium. He is interested in exploratory research methods.

Outside of research, he enjoys reading philosophy, watching insects and birds, listening to music, and running a YouTube channel in Farsi on philosophy and sometimes signal processing.

## Lab Ethos

We prioritize **open, reproducible, and transparent research**. Sharing code, data, and methods is central to our approach. We encourage curiosity-driven research, collaboration, and mentoring, fostering an environment where ideas can be explored rigorously and creatively.

---

## Philosophy

Our philosophy is that the brain should be studied **as it operates naturally over time**, rather than only through artificial, discrete experiments. Continuous, naturalistic EEG recordings capture the ongoing dynamics of cognition, attention, and perception, offering richer insights into neural computation.

---

## Vision

We aim to understand how **neural dynamics unfold over time** in both spontaneous and task-driven activity. By integrating EEG with computational modeling, we hope to reveal principles of brain function, bridging basic neuroscience with real-world applications in cognition, learning, and behavior.
