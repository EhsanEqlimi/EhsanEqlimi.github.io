**About my name**

My name is Ehsan. It is pronounced as /eh sa:n/ in IPA and written as احسان in Persian/Farsi. The 'E' in Ehsan is closer to /e/ as in 'say' rather than /ɛ/ as in 'bed'. Wrong pronunciation that I have heard for my name: [i:za:n], and wrong spelling: Eshan! There's a sunny treatment to pronouncing my name: it's 'eh + sun,' with the focus on 'sun.' So, I'm often known as 'Ehsun,' bringing a little sunshine to the pronunciation :)

Ehsan is a Persian name meaning "benefaction." Originally, it comes from Arabic, and there are different meanings and applications, as well as pronunciations, of Ehsan in Persian and Arabic. The equivalent in pure Persian for my name, Ehsan, is Niki (which means "to do beautiful things"). 

My last name is Eqlimi. It is pronouced as /eqliːˈmiː/ and /eɣliːˈmiː/ and written as اقلیمی in Persian/Farsi. The 'q' sound is similar to 'r' in French or 'gh/غ' in Arabic. /q/ and /ɣ/ in modern Persian is combianed and more proncation is like /ɣ/ rather than /q/. 

Just as my first name is related to the sun :), my last name is associated with weather or climate. The Persian word "اقلیم" (Eqlim), "اقلیم" (Eqlim) in Persian is an Arabized version of the Greek word "κλίμα" (klima), which means "climate" or "region".
