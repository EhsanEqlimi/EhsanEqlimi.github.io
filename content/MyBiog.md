**About my name**

My name is Ehsan. It is pronounced as /eh sa:n/ in IPA and written as احسان in Persian/Farsi. The 'E' in Ehsan is closer to /e/ as in 'say' rather than /ɛ/ as in 'bed'.

Wrong pronunciation that I have heard for my name: [i:za:n], and wrong spelling: Eshan! There's a sunny treatment to pronouncing my name: it's 'eh + sun,' with the focus on 'sun.' So, I'm often known as 'Ehsun,' bringing a little sunshine to the pronunciation.

Ehsan is a Persian name meaning "benefaction." Originally, it comes from Arabic, and there are different meanings and applications, as well as pronunciations, of this name in Persian and Arabic. The equivalent in pure Persian for my name, Ehsan, is Niki (which means "to do beautiful things"). 

My famyli name is Eqlimi. It is pronouced as /eqliːˈmiː/ and written as اقلیمی in Persian/Farsi.
