**Core Basics in ML, Signal Processing, and More**

- Static PDF file:** [Lecture Notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1988qrCvkNBW9cMu4tK26waSTcn7tkrGc/view?usp=drive_link)  
- Dynamic PDF file:** You can access the lecture PDF [here on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/jkrnvmtygjvq#7bdfdd). In the future, a full Jupyter Book version will be available for interactive learning.  

Inspired by *The Fall* by Albert Camus, this channel explores how vectors—the building blocks of ML—“fall” into patterns, signals, and representations, uncovering hidden structures in data.

**Short Tutorial on Cross-Spectrum and Coherence in EEG**

In my 2018 PhD progress report, I discussed the cross-spectrum and coherence in EEG. You can view it [[here]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bfLubvkt43VaJ6wpPj8LKAhvhSeWkeXt/view?usp=drive_link)


**Tutorial on EEG Time-Frequency Representation in the Context of Envelope Following Response (EFR)**

This tutorial is part of the supplementary materials for my PhD thesis. It focuses on EEG time-frequency representation in the context of the Envelope Following Response (EFR), also known as the Frequency Following Response (FFR). Topics include induced and evoked responses, phase-locked and non-phase-locked power, and more.  Chekt it out here. Enjoy!
