In this channel, I teach the core concepts of machine learning, signal processing, linear algebra, probability, information theory… and yes, a little bit of noise. This is just the beginning, and more content is coming soon. You can find the PDF of the lectures [here on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/jkrnvmtygjvq#7bdfdd). In the future, I plan to add a full Jupyter Book version for interactive learning.

Inspired by *The Fall* by Albert Camus, the channel reflects a curiosity about how vectors—the building blocks of ML “fall” into patterns, signals, and representations, revealing the hidden structure in data.
