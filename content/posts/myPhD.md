My Ph.D. research unveiled two main findings. First, I identified that distinct oscilations in the brain correlate with attentional engagement in speech perception, as reflected in their varied frequency features. Second, I developed a method to qunatify attentional engagemnet during speech listening by tracking the evolving complexity of EEG over time.
