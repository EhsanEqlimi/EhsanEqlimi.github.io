I'm a research scientist specializing in exploring the fundamental aspects of brain oscillations, EEG signals, and their underlying cognitive processes, particularly in auditory perception.

Pronouncing my name is easy - just say 'Eh' and then 'sun' as if you've suddenly spotted it in the sky!

I earned my Ph.D., M.Sc., & B.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering from Ghent University (in 2022), Tehran University (in 2013), & Sahand University of Technology (in 2010), respectively.
