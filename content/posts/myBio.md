My name is Ehsan, pronounced [eh saːn] in IPA and written as احسان in Persian/Farsi. I currently work as a data scientist in the Process and Quality Department at Azorg Hospital in Allast, Belgium. I hold a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering with a focus on neural signal processing.

I received my Ph.D. from Ghent University in 2022, my M.Sc. from the University of Tehran in 2013, and my B.Sc. from Sahand University of Technology in 2010—all in Biomedical Engineering.

My Ph.D. research unveiled two main findings. First, I identified that distinct oscilations in the brain correlate with attentional engagement in speech perception, as reflected in their varied frequency features. Second, I developed a method to qunatify attentional engagemnet during speech listening by tracking the evolving complexity of EEG over time. For a more in-depth exploration, feel free to access my Ph.D. thesis:
 [Exploring neural markers modulated by learning from speech in environmental noise using single-trial EEG (Doctoral dissertation, Ghent University)](https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/01GJ5HTSJYBWAG656CTYKSG7A4), [[PDF]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365565540_Exploring_neural_markers_modulated_by_learning_from_speech_in_environmental_noise_using_single-trial_EEG).
