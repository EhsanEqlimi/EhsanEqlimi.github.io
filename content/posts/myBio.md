My name is Ehsan. It is pronounced as [eh sa:n] in IPA and written as احسان in Persian/Farsi. Wrong pronunciation that I have heard for my name: [i:za:n], and wrong spelling: Eshan!


It is a Persian name meaning "benefaction." Originally, it comes from Arabic, and there are different meanings and applications, as well as pronunciations, of this name in Persian and Arabic. The equivalent in pure Persian for my name, Ehsan, is Niki (which means "to do beautiful things"). 



Pronouncing my name is easy - just say 'Eh' and then 'sun' as if you've suddenly spotted it in the sky!
