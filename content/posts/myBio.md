I'm a research scientist specializing in exploring the fundamental aspects of brain oscillations, focusing on EEG signals and their underlying cognitive processes, particularly in the context of auditory perception. Pronouncing my name is easy - just say 'eh' and then 'sun' as if you've suddenly spotted it in the sky!
